# #48: KAPE - Task 7 ⚔️

I had to act as a forensic analyst for **Organization X**, which suspected that a user violated company policy by:

- Using **removable drives (USBs)**
- **Installing software** from network drives
- Connecting to **unknown networks**

Using KAPE and EZViewer, I investigated the system to confirm these activities.

## Step-by-Step Process

### **Step 1: Run KAPE**

1. Go to the **KAPE directory** on the Desktop in the attached VM.
2. Open **GKAPE** (the GUI version) or use CLI if preferred.

### **Step 2: Find USB Devices (Question 7.1)**

1. Open **USBSTOR.csv** inside the Registry folder using **EZViewer** (from the EZtools folder).

2. You’ll see two registry entries showing USB device details.

3. One is `0123456789ABCDE` (already known).
4. The **other USB’s serial number** listed is:
    
    **Answer:** `1C6F654E59A3B0C179D366AE`

### **Step 3: Check Software Installation Source (Question 7.2)**

1. In the same Registry folder, open **RecentApps.csv** using EZViewer.
    
    ![image.png](image%206.png)
    
2. Look for entries where software like **7zip, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox** were installed.

3. The drive letter and directory are shown as:
    
    **Answer:** `Z:\setups`
    

---

### **Step 4: Verify Execution Date of CHROMESETUP.EXE (Question 7.3)**

1. Still in **RecentApps.csv**, find the entry for **CHROMESETUP.EXE**.
2. The timestamp column gives the execution date and time.

3. It shows:
    
    **Answer:** `11/25/2021 3:33`

### **Step 5: Find Search Query Performed on System (Question 7.4)**

1. Open **WordWheelQuery.csv** in the same Registry subfolder.
    
    ![image.png](image%209.png)
    
2. This file contains **Windows Search history**.
3. The recorded query was:
    
    ![image.png](image%2010.png)
    
    **Answer:** `RunWallpaperSetup.cmd`
    

---

### **Step 6: Check Network Connection Time (Question 7.5)**

1. Open **KnownNetworks.csv** in the same Registry subfolder.
    
    ![image.png](image%2011.png)
    
2. This file lists Wi-Fi or LAN networks previously connected.
3. Locate the network named **Network 3**.
4. The “FirstConnected” column shows:
    
    ![image.png](image%2012.png)
    
    **Answer:** `11/30/2021 15:44`
    

---

### **Step 7: Find the Drive Letter of KAPE’s Source (Question 7.6)**

1. Open the **AutomaticDestinations.csv** file from ‘FireFolderAccess” folder.
    
    ![image.png](image%2013.png)
    
2. Search for any entry showing **KAPE** being accessed or copied.
3. It indicates that KAPE was copied from drive:

    **Answer:** `E:`

### Summary

By analyzing registry artifacts collected through **KAPE** and reviewing them in **EZViewer**, I confirmed multiple Acceptable Use Policy violations:

- User connected **two USB drives** (one Kingston).
- Installed apps from a **network drive (Z:\setups)**.
- Connected to an **unauthorized network (Network 3)**.
- Searched for and executed suspicious commands (`RunWallpaperSetup.cmd`).

These findings clearly demonstrate that the user violated the organization’s policy.
